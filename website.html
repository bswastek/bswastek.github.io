<p>Developing writers can often benefit from examining an essay, a paragraph, or even a sentence to determine what makes it effective. On the following pages are several paragraphs for you to evaluate on your own, along with the Writing Center's explanation.

Note: These passages are excerpted from actual student papers and retain the original wording. Some of the sentences are imperfect, but we have chosen these passages to highlight areas in which the author was successful.

Thanks to the students who provided their writing for this page of our website. Do you have a discussion post, paper, or other writing assignment that you are particularly proud of? We would love to use it as a sample. Contact us at writingsupport@waldenu.edu if you would like to share.</p>

<p>I'm super pumped up about Michigan's latest recruiting class. They got the top wide receiver in the country and landed him over rivals MSU and OSU! They also took two top 150 recruits, including a 5 star defensive tackle, and pulled them out of SEC country on signing day to prove who the top program in the country is. One thing that I am
worried about is definitely the offensive line situation. Right now there's a gaping hole at tackle and nobody knows who will go there. Maybe we can get a grad transfer? It sucks that we missed out on Wilson, I have no doubt that Georgia paid him. Well, gotta go. I'll talk to you later!</p> <aside>
In the end, Michigan's class will be ranked number five in the nation.</aside>
